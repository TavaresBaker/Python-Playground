# Python Projects 

This repo is a collection of all my Python code as I learn and grow with the language. Some of it’s simple, some of it’s weird, and some of it might even be useful.

Feel free to look around, clone it, break it, improve it. Use anything in here for any legal purpose, personal or professional. No need to credit me unless you really want to.

## What You'll Find

- Small tools and scripts
- Random experiments
- Projects I’m messing with as I learn Python
- Notes and comments to help me (or someone else) understand what’s going on

## No License

There’s no license file here because I don’t care how you use this code. You can:
- Use it in your own projects
- Remix or rewrite it

## Why This Exists

I’m teaching myself Python, and this repo is my way of tracking progress, staying organized, and maybe helping someone else doing the same thing. Expect messy code, but expect to see growth.

## About Me

I'm Tavares. I like cybersecurity and networking, but I’m diving into programming to assist in my classwork, automation, and scripting.
